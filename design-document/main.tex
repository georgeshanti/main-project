\section{Purpose}
MultiFrame Hand Gesture GUI Control System Using Convex Hull Algorithm version 1 revision 1 - A Real time dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition GUI system to improve the interaction between user and computer. The user can use his webcam to record hand gestures which our system can use to perform Linux GUI functions in realtime.

\section{Overview}

The System Architecture provides a view into how the different blocks of the system is organized.
There are mainly four stages in this system. They are Background Subtraction, Feature Extraction,Finger-Tip Tracking, Gesture Recognition and Gesture Mapping.
The image input frames are analyzed and the hand gesture is detected from the multiple frames.
\\
\\
The Use case diagram has the different functions which are targeted at different user classes.
\\
\\
The class structure has been described in the class diagram. There is a main abstract class from which two 
sub-classes are derived; SavedGestures and DetectedGestures. \\
\\
\\
The flow of activity has been shown in the activity diagram. All the actions from the start, i.e the user gesture to the mapping and execution of the LINUX GUI function has been shown.
\\
\\
The algorithms section describe the different algorithms used in the system.
MOG2, Convex Hull, Camshift and Brute Force Matching are the main algorithms used.

\section{Module 1 - Image Retrieval}
The first step in this system is to retrieve the contiguous camera image frames. The user shows the hand-gesture 
and it is retrieved via the webcam. The images are captured at short intervals to accommodate multi-frame fluid hand-gestures.
\\
The camera feed is retrieved from the user's webcam using the CaptureFromCAM function provided by OpenCV.
\\
The function reads an image from the specified buffer in the memory. If the buffer is too short or contains invalid data, the empty matrix/image is returned.
\section{Module 2 - Background Subtraction}
The captured image from the camera needs to undergo background subtraction in order to recognize the gesture correctly. 
The different elements in the background has to be discarded and only the shape of the hand is retained. 
\\
The Mixture of Gaussians (MOG) method is used for foreground detection, and once the foreground is detected, we subtract the rest of the image, i. e., the background.
we need to create a background object using the function, cv.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG(). 
It has some optional parameters like length of history, number of gaussian mixtures, threshold etc. 
Then we use backgroundsubtractor.apply() method to get the foreground mask.
\section{Module 3 - Feature Extraction}
The next step is to find the fingertip locations in the recorded image from the background subtracted image.
To recognize the fingertips we use the Convex Hull algorithm. 
\\
The locations of the fingertips on the screen are detected by finding the Convex hull of the 
hand and marking the peaks. This process is done in realtime and the extracted location changes
 with every frame. 
 
 The function find the convex hull of a 2D point set using the Sklanskyâ€™s algorithm
 that has O(N logN) complexity in the current implementation. The algorithm consisted of two parts. 
 Part 1 was intended to take a simple polygon and return a maximal polygon (monotonic in both the 
 horizontal and vertical directions). Part 2 was Sklansky's original algorithm, which
 was guaranteed to work on the output of part 1, since maximal polygons are weakly externally visible,
 and it is proven that Sklansky's original algorithm works for such polygons.

\section{Module 4 - Finger-Tip Tracking}
After extracting the finger tip information, we need to track the finger tips over multiple frames. 
cv.camShift() is the function that is used. 
Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift Algorithm (CAMShift) is used to detect the changes from frame to frame. 
The probability distribution of the first frame is taken as a reference for the second frame, 
the probability distribution of the second frame is taken for the third frame and so on and so forth.

\section{Module 5 - Gesture Recognition}
The convex hull and convexity defects along with the results of the CAMShift algorithm are 
used to create a mathematical state of the currently recorded gesture. This state is compared 
with the states of the saved gestures and the closest candidate is chosen.

We use Brute Force matching to find the closest saved gesture. First we create 
ORB descriptors (Oriented FAST (Features from accelerated segment test) and Rotated BRIEF 
(Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)) and these descriptors are checked by using the 
Brute Force matcher.  

\section{Module 6 - Gesture Mapping}

Once the correct gesture has been identified, 
the corresponding class object is accessed to procure the GUI function that has been saved 
for that particular gesture. The function is first executed, and then the daemon starts listening 
for the next gesture.

\chapter{Conclusion}
MultiFrame Hand Gesture GUI Control System using Convex Hull Algorithm is a suitable system to perform basic GUI functions using dynamic hand gestures. 
\\

The input feed is divided into individual frames taken at multiple intervals. These image frames are then passed into the Background Subtraction Module which isolates the Region of Interest.
The images are then quantized to grayscale, and passed through the Convex Hull Algorithm to extract the fingertip points.
Then, the motion of the fingertips is tracked using the tracking algorithm from the multiple frames, and the dynamic gesture is retrieved and saved as the detected gesture.
This object is then compared using Brute Force Matching against all the saved gestures to find a suitable match. Once a match is found, the corresponding GUI function is executed.
\\

The algorithms specified in Section 4 are optimized and relatively fast, and are highly accurate.
\\

Hence, this is an easy-to-use and a highly expandable system for interfacing with the personal computer.
